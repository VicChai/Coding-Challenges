// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

// I love you
// a little
// a lot
// passionately
// madly
// not at all
// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.

function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
    // your code
  return nbPetals % 6 === 1 || nbPetals === 1 ? "I love you" 
        : nbPetals % 6 === 2 || nbPetals === 2 ? "a little" 
        : nbPetals % 6 === 3 || nbPetals === 3 ? "a lot" 
        : nbPetals % 6 === 4 || nbPetals === 4 ? "passionately" 
        : nbPetals % 6 === 5 || nbPetals === 5 ? "madly" : "not at all"
